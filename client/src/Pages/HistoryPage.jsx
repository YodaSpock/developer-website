                    During the course of senior year, myself and 5 others have been slowly but surely developing an Intelligent Code
                    Editor. The project is to take natural language and convert that into executable Java code. We made an IntelliJ 
                    plugin that allows users to highlight natural language and translate into Java code. We do this by running a machine
                    learning OpenNMT-py model through with an extensive hand-made dataset that allows users to select from multiple options
                    when doing translations. We do a fair amount of preprocessing with the data, something I particularly worked on, by 
                    filtering out words that aren't nouns or verbs. I also worked on creating a large dataset for our model to use, since 
                    we unable to find a suitable dataset for our purposes. As the semester comes to a close I will be sad to part with this
                    project.

                   Sunday morning. The gameplay was clunky and not ideal, but it was a great experience working with Node.js and 
                   working with web sockets. It was also a great experience working with two other great programmers on such a fun

                    before. I was in charge on not only the database setup, maintance and the server code but I quickly became

                    spent many hours debugging, and programming together. Apart from my internship it was the biggest eye opener
                    for realizing how important team communication is.

                    I recently had the privelege of landing an summer intership at Buildertrend, a leading software development company based in Omaha,
                    Nebraska, that focuses on building construction managment 
                    software for helping builders and contractors run their business. There have been ranked as the #1 place to work in Omaha, 
                    Nebraska for the past two years, and I can say it was an amazing place to work.

                  <p className = "historyParagraph">
                    Over my time there, I became very familiar with React devlopment as my job became converting old web forms pages into new React 
                    components. This greatly improved the loading time for the web application, and also improved the look of the website. I also 
                    learned and improved my skills in  .NET framework, Typescript, Javascript, MySQL, CSS, HTML, and learned 
                    how to work in an Agile style environment. At Buildertrend we worked in teams of 5 developers and we incorporated daily standups 
                    and peer code reviews into our routine.

                    During the internship I competed with 3 fellow interns in a hackathon housted by Buildertrend, and we tried to develop a crude version
                    of an improved image editor. We spent 48 developing and had to present our final product at the end of the weekend. We ended up winning 
                    people's choice for the event. At the end of the intership I had finished several components and I am very proud to say that all the 
                    components I developed are currently in production and are helping contractors and builders improve their business.

                    the project and focuse on the sonar, IR, cliff, and bump sensors for the input. I had to detect any drop offs before
                    roomba fell in, and detect any small obstacles with the bump sensors. And then finally any large obstacles would be 
                    detected with the sonar and IR sensors. I was responsible for adjusting the data we recieved and 
                    correcting to get a the smallest error possible. I was then responsible for the sending the data to the UI so we can
                    correctly navgiate a maze of obstacles.

                    This was my second hackathon with a my roommate and a couple other friends where we had plan to develop an Alexa skill. 
                    Our idea for this skill was a burning house scneario where you have to verbally search the room you were in for clues before 
                    the timer ran out and the house burnt down. It was a great experience although we never completed a finished product. We had
                    issues with interacting with the Alexa API to even start our application. It was a learning experience in the fact that we 
                    had spent so much time working on other aspects of the project such as utterances of what the user could say as well as the 
                    interaction between objects in a OOP setting but not focusing on the core aspect of integrating with Alexa.

                    This was my first ever hackathon, and it was with some people I barely knew at the time. We decided to make a webpage that
                    compared ISU credits to other community colleges and universities in Iowa to see what would transfer. All data was hardcoded 
                    and displayed directly to the user. The biggest challenge with this project was learning to work with others on a project.
                    This was the first time I had really run into issues concerning others on a programming project. I found out rather late that a 
                    few of us were working on the same thing becuase we did not have a good plan or communication. Overall it was a great learning 
                    experience and introduction to git as well as some front end development aspects.
